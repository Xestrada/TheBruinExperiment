			<p>Age: 21

			Bio: I have always been sort of a science nerd; physics and math are my favorite subjects. At one point, my co-founder, Katie Mowris, and I decided we wanted to share our love for science with younger students so we created TheBruinExperiment. On my own time, I like to drum, watch movies and run long distances. In the future, I hope to become a neurosurgeon. </p>

			<div class = "seperate">
			<p>When I first came to Ken, the head of the science department at LACES, with our idea to help orchestrate a science fair, he was enthusiastic and accepting. He saw a bunch of college students brimming with passion and a desire to spread scientific curiosity and related that in his day, he had done the same. With Ken’s help, we were able to successfully integrate our “science fair” curriculum with that of LACES and create the first ever “Bruin Science Fair!” It was obvious to me from the way his students and fellow faculty treated him, that Ken is truly a respectable individual. He’s an excellent instructor and mentor to the students at LACES and was truly integral to the success of TheBruinExperiment. 	-Daniel Haiem, President of TheBruinExperiment </p>
