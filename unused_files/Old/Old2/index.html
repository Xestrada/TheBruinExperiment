        	<h3>Reaching Out</h3>
				<img src="reaching_out.jpg" alt = "Reaching Out" class = "left">
				<p class = "TL">Let’s be honest, how many young students, especially in the underserved community, are truly passionate about science? Unfortunately, very few are.  We plan to change this, and inspire a sense of scientific curiosity in these underserved youth through the orchestration of self-initiated science fairs. Our ultimate goal is to help these students see that just because science in the classroom can be difficult, that does not mean it can’t be both beautiful and fun.</p>

            <h3>Leadership</h3>
				<img src="leadership.jpg" alt = "Leadership" class = "right">
				<p class = "TR">Our team is as dedicated to inspiring curious students as it is to developing student leaders here at UCLA. In mentoring these young, inquisitive students, the mentors themselves gain hands-on, personal leadership experience. Members of our team lead various clubs, fraternities, sororities, and non-profits within both north and south campus. Remember, you don’t need to be a science major to be a leader within The Bruin Experiment; all majors are welcome!</p>

            <h3>Curiosity</h3>
				<img src="curiosity.jpg" alt = "Curiosity" class = "left">
				<p class = "TL">A child’s mind is a wonderful thing, and giving students the proper avenue to pursue their creative endeavors is the reason this club exists. As college students who’ve been through it all, we understand that textbook science can sometimes be boring and inefficient. By fostering curiosity in our club, we help the students learn about the scientific method from a first hand experience. They choose their own projects based on their own passions and work at their own pace—we merely guide them along the way.</p>

            <h3 class = "h3l">Family</h3>
				<img src="Images/family.jpg" alt = "Family" class = "right">
				<p class = "TR" id = "family">At the end of the day, the purpose of this club is to make sure the students, as well as the mentors, are having a blast. Whether it’s with a student or a fellow mentor, we want to make sure that our members are constantly having the best experience possible at TBE.</p>
