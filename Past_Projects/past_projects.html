I chose to do this project because I have always been fascinated with the effect of words and pictures on one’s memory. I am interested in this because I tend to memorize weird things and I have had a fascination with memory since I can remember. My main goal in life is to really do something great and make my mark on the world. I don't exactly know what, but I think I will become an architect, interior designer, or actress. </p>

			<p id = "catherineP">My name is Catherine Or and I am a current 6th grader at LACES. I have participated in The Bruin Experiment and had fun with the fabulous mentors, especially Daniel Haiem and Katie Mowris. My project was on testing organic fruits and vegetables for pesticides. The reason I wanted to do this was because people should not pay extra for organic fruits and vegetables if they are not actually organic. I used a kit that I found online to test for pesticides. Most results came out the way I expected, but a few did not. For example, some organic fruits and vegetables came out positive, which means they contain pesticides. On the other hand, some conventional fruits and vegetables did not contain pesticides. Overall, this project was very fun. I learned a lot about this topic and the scientific method. Also, this has helped me realize that science fair can be more fun than I thought. 	Thank you to The Bruin Experiment team who came (despite their college schoolwork, tests and studying) and did a science fair with us because it was very fun, especially being able to connect and work with with younger mentors. </p>

For my Science Fair experiment I wanted to find out if adding nitrogen resources to soil would help plants grow faster. I chose this because I really like plants and I like how they grow. Plants are similar to humans in the sense that they both need water to grow bigger and stronger. We need plants for oxygen and they need us for carbon dioxide. I really enjoyed my project. I learned a lot from it and got a lot of help from my mentors. I am really looking forward to doing this again next year. </p>

			<p id = "jesseP">My project dealt with Benford’s Law, a mathematical rule dictating the distribution of the initial digits of numbers in a set of data. In this distribution, lower numbers appear more frequently. Although this is often true, it is not ubiquitous, but knowledge of its applicability (or lack thereof) can be quite useful. For my project, I examined said ubiquity, in two kinds of data: natural (pertaining to the natural world or things outside of human control) and artificial (data about human-made things.) I found that Benford’s Law was far more likely to appear in artificial cases than natural ones. </p>

			<p id = "gabyP">My name is Gaby Cohen and I am currently in 7th grade at the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies.  This year I participated in TheBruinExperiment, which is a science fair organized by some pretty incredible UCLA students.  My project was called "Through All Those Nooks and Crannies."  I tested the water filtering properties of many mostly natural materials, including sand, gravel, diatomaceous earth, coffee filters, activated charcoal, and polyester batting, to find which combination of materials make for the best filtering medium.  To achieve this, I created homemade filters made of 2 liter plastic bottles, a little polyester fabric and different mixtures of these materials.  Through these homemade filters I poured muddy water that I made.  The goal of this project was not only to determine the best water filtering media, but also to possibly find a natural, convenient and abundant way to filter water in foreign countries, which lack clean water.  I chose this project because I can't even imagine what some of these countries must be going through and the fact that for them clean water is so limited, when it is something I take for granted makes me want to help. Thank you so much to TheBruinExperiment for such an interesting experience! </p>

			<p id = "davidP">I might seem like an ordinary boy living his boring life at first, but if you really know me, you know that's not the case. Since I was a baby, I have been taking things apart and learning how it worked, many of the times I was successful in putting them back together. I started learning with LEGOs in fourth grade. I had a great coach to teach me how to build and program with NXT. Soon after that, I started working with real machinery and programming in C++. This was also how I chose my project topic. New forms of rechargeable energy storages were arriving on the market and I was interested. The most commonly known storage is the rechargeable battery. Capacitors are less known, but hey appear in all modern electronics, holding charges in between layers of insulators. I was comparing those two relatively old forms of storages to the all-new super capacitor. I was wondering how exactly was a super capacitor 'super'. Not only did my research tell me that it was it had a superior charge rate and huge capacity, but I discovered it also was superior in its size and weight when I received the package. This is only the beginning. New forms of super capacitors are being made, ones that are one tenth the width of a piece of paper and can store twice the energy of a regular super capacitor.</p>
